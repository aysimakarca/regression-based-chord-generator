   [C#]Words are flowing out like[A#m] endless rain into a [Fm]paper cup      
   They sli[D#m7]ther while they pass they slip away across the u[G#]niverse                          [G#7]         
   [C#]Pools of sorrow, waves of[A#m] joy are drifting thro[Fm]ugh my opened mind      
   Posse[D#m7]ssing and caressing[F#m] me      

   [C#]Jai Guru Deva Om     [G#7]         
   [G#7]Nothing's gonna change my world      
   [F#]Nothing's gonna change my world              [C#]        
   [G#7]Nothing's gonna change my world      
   [F#]Nothing's gonna change my world              [C#]        

   [C#]Images of broke[A#m]n light which dance before[Fm] me like a million eyes               [D#m7]           
   They call me on and on across the univ[G#]erse                [G#7]         
   [C#]Thoughts meander like a restl[A#m]ess wind inside a[Fm] letterbox      
   They tum[D#m7]ble blindly as they make their way across the [G#]universe                      [G#7]         

   [C#]Jai Guru Deva Om     [G#7]         
   [G#7]Nothing's gonna change my world      
   [F#]Nothing's gonna change my world              [C#]        
   [G#7]Nothing's gonna change my world      
   [F#]Nothing's gonna change my world              [C#]        

   [C#]Sounds of laughter, shades of l[A#m]ife                        
   are ri[Fm]nging through my opened ears      
   Inc[D#m7]iting and invi[F#m]ting me      
   [C#]Limitless, undying l[A#m]ove which shines      [Fm]                                     
   around me like a million suns       [D#m7]          
   And calls me on and on across the univ[G#]erse                 [G#7]                  

   [C#]Jai Guru Deva Om     [G#7]         
   [G#7]Nothing's gonna change my world      
   [F#]Nothing's gonna change my world              [C#]        
   [G#7]Nothing's gonna change my world      
   [F#]Nothing's gonna change my world              [C#]        

[Em] [C#] [A#m] [Fm] [D#m7] [G#]
