Intro C  A#  G 

[C]In the night, there are [A#]sights to be s[G]een

I [C]still see that [F]picture of[C] you 

[Em]It was last[Dm] summer[Em], I fell i[Dm]n love 
[Em]My heart[Dm] told me what t[Em]o do[G]  
[C]I saw you there on the [G]crest of a [C]hill 
[C]An' I took a little [G]picture of [C]you 

[C]Then you were gone, like a [A#]dream in the n[G]ight 
[C]With you went my heart, my [A#]love and my l[G]ife 
I [F]didn't know your name, what could I [G]do? 
[C]I only had a [F]picture of [C]you
