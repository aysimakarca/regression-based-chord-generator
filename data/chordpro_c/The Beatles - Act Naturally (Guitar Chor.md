[G]They're gonna put me in the [C]movies

And [D]all I gotta do is Act Natura[G]lly 

Well I [D]bet you I'm gonna be a [G]big star 
I might [D]win an Oscar  You can never [G]tell 
The [D]movies gonna make me a [G]big star 
Because [A]I can play the part so [D]well 

[G]Well I hope you come and see me in the [C]movies 
[G]Then I know that you will plainly [D]see 
The [G]biggest fool that ever hit the big [C]time 
And [D]all I gotta do is Act Natura[G]lly
