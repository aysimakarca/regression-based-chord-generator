Intro: C Em Am Am7 F F  


[C] I read the [G/B]news today oh b[Am]oy [Am7]     
[F] About a [F/E]lucky man who m[Dm7]ade the grade   
[C] And though the [Em]news was rather [Am]sad  [Am7]     
[F] Well I [A#]just had to laugh [Am]      [Am7]    
[F] I saw the[A#] photograph[Am]     [F]  

[C] He blew his[G/B] mind out in a c[Am]ar   [Am7]    
[F] He didn't [F/E]notice that the [Dm7]lights had changed 
[C] A crowd of [Em]people stood and s[Am]tared [Am7]    
[F] They'd seen his[A#] face before 
[Am] Nobody was really sure                             
 [Am7]If he was from the House of[F] Lords 

[C] I saw a[G/B] film today oh [Am]boy   [Am7]    
[F] The English[F/E] Army had just[Dm7] won the war 
[C] A crowd of[Em] people turned a[Am]way  [Am7]    
[F] But I just[A#] had to look [Am]   
Having [Am7]read the b[F]ook 

F                 E5             
 I'd love to turn you on 

[Instrumental:E] 

[A] Woke up, fell out of bed, dragged a comb across my [G9]head 
Found my w[A]ay downstairs and d[E7]rank a cup 
And [A]looking up, I [E7]noticed I was late. Ha, ha, ha. 
Found my co[A]at and grabbed my hat                                      
Made the bus in seconds [G9]flat 
Found my w[A]ay upstairs and [E7]had a smoke 
And [A]somebody spoke and I went [E7]into a dream 

A[F]h.[C].. [G] A[D]h...  [A]Ah...  [F] A[C]h...  [G]Ah[D]...    [A]   [G]   [F]   [G]  

[C] I read the [G/B]news today oh bo[Am]y    [Am7]    
[F] Four thousand[F/E] holes in Blackburn,[Dm7] Lancashire. 
[C] And though the [G/B]holes were rather sm[Am]all   [Am7]    
[F] They had to c[A#]ount them all; 
[Am] Now they know how many holes it t[Am7]akes to fill the Albert H[F]all. 
                   E5 
 I'd love to turn you on.
